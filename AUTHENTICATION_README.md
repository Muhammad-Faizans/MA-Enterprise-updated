  - Automatic login prompt for guest users
  - User information attached to orders

- **User-Specific Features**
  - Personalized shopping experience
  - User data in order history
  - Secure payment processing

## Technical Implementation

### Firebase Configuration
The authentication system uses Firebase Authentication with the following services:
- Email/Password authentication
- Google OAuth provider
- User profile management
- Session persistence

### Components Structure
```
src/Components/
├── Login.jsx          # Login form with email/password and Google OAuth
├── Signup.jsx         # Registration form with validation
└── Profile.jsx        # User profile management and settings
```

### State Management
- Authentication state is managed in the main App component
- User session persistence across page reloads
- Real-time authentication state updates

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
Ensure your Firebase project has Authentication enabled:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method
4. Enable Email/Password and Google providers

### 2. Google OAuth Setup
For Google sign-in to work:
1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Enable Google provider
3. Add your authorized domains
4. Configure OAuth consent screen if needed

### 3. Security Rules
Update your Firestore security rules to protect user data:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to create orders
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.userInfo.uid == request.auth.uid || 
         request.auth.token.admin == true);
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Registration**: Click "Sign Up" and create an account with email/password or Google
2. **Login**: Use "Sign In" to access your account
3. **Profile Management**: Click your name in the header to access profile settings
4. **Shopping**: Browse products and add to cart (login required for checkout)

### For Developers
The authentication system is fully integrated into the existing e-commerce functionality:
- Protected routes and features
- User-specific data handling
- Secure order processing
- Responsive design for all devices

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices Implemented
- Password strength validation
- Re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Secure session management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Data Protection
- User passwords are never stored locally
- Authentication tokens are managed by Firebase
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication
- Account deletion requires password confirmation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Google Sign-in not working**: Check Firebase console settings and authorized domains
2. **Email verification**: Ensure your Firebase project has email verification enabled
3. **Password reset**: Implement password reset functionality if needed
4. **Mobile responsiveness**: All authentication components are mobile-optimized

### Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid credentials
- Account already exists
- Weak passwords
- Email format errors

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Phone number authentication
- Social media login (Facebook, Twitter)
- Two-factor authentication
- Admin user management
- User roles and permissions

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of authentication components
- Optimistic UI updates
- Caching strategies
- Progressive Web App features

## Support

For technical support or questions about the authentication system:
1. Check Firebase documentation
2. Review error messages in browser console
3. Verify Firebase project configuration
4. Test with different browsers and devices
